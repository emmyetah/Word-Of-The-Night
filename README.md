# Word-Of-The-Night
The Word Of The Night program was designed to improve my vocabulary, however adapted to include any friends and family that wanted to do the same. I use task scheduler to run this code everyday at 10pm which enables an email to be sent to all emails within the email list including a new Word Of The Night.
